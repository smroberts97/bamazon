# bamazon

This app is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, Inquirer and Node.

This app takes orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

Users view a table of offered products. The app asks you what you would like to purchase by entering the product id number. The app then asks how many of the product you would like to buy. The app verifies that the desired quantity is available, and returns a price for the order. The app then decreases the amount of the item by the number the user has purchased. If the user desires more of an item than there is inventory for, the app will let them know that the quantity does not exist.

A few screenshots of the app:
